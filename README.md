## What is the app?
These are applications for personal / home finance. In this application, the user can enter their daily expenses by choosing the categories where the finances were spent. It is convenient to control expenses in the application, plan large purchases and expenses for the coming months. All expenses are categorized to make it easier to record and calculate. For clarity, the application plots graphs: it shows in which area of life you spend most of your money.
